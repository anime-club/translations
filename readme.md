## Project structure

- all languages are available in [/src](/src) directory
- if a translation phrase is **not translated yet**:

  - it has a prefix `"(en) "`

    - for example if you see in [/src/japanese.ts](/src/japanese.ts):

      ```ts
      deleteArt: `(en) Delete art`,
      ```

      - it means we have **not** translated this phrase yet

- the translation phrase might be either:

  - a static value:

    ```ts
    addBlog: `Add blog`,
    ```

  - or a value that changes (`n` will be replaced on the website):

    ```ts
    addedNAgo: (n) => `Added ${n} ago`,
    ```
